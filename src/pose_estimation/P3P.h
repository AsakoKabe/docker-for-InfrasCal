 * Description: Compute the absolute pose of a camera using three 3D-to-2D correspondences
 *   Reference: A Novel Parametrization of the P3P-Problem for a Direct Computation of
 *              Absolute Camera Position and Orientation
 *
 *       Input: featureVectors: vector of 3D UNITARY feature vectors
 *              worldPoints: vector of 3D world points
 *              solutions: vector of homogeneous transforms
 *                         the obtained transforms are defined as transforming points from the cam to the world frame
 *      Output: bool: true if correct execution
 *                    false if world points aligned
